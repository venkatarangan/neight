IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY: AppData Fallback for Settings

Date: October 10, 2025
Issue: Settings file cannot be saved in Program Files (x86) due to write permissions

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
====================

1. Modified SettingsManager class in neight.py to support dual-location strategy:

   PRIMARY LOCATION (Preferred):
   - Same folder as executable/script
   - Used when write permissions are available
   - Path: <executable_folder>\settings.json

   FALLBACK LOCATION (AppData):
   - Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Neight\settings.json
   - Linux/Mac: ~/.config/Neight/settings.json
   - Used when primary location is not writable

2. Key Features:
   ✓ Automatic write permission detection
   ✓ Seamless fallback to AppData when needed
   ✓ Auto-migration of existing settings
   ✓ Cross-platform compatible
   ✓ No user intervention required

3. Behavior:
   
   First Launch:
   - Tests write permission in executable folder
   - If writable → saves to executable folder
   - If not writable → saves to AppData
   
   Subsequent Launches:
   - Checks primary location first
   - Falls back to AppData if needed
   - Migrates settings automatically if permissions change
   
   Program Files Installation:
   - Detects read-only environment
   - Automatically uses AppData location
   - Settings persist across app updates

4. Files Modified:
   - neight.py: SettingsManager class (lines 88-197)
   - README.md: Added documentation about settings location
   - SETTINGS_LOCATION.md: Detailed technical documentation

5. Testing:
   ✓ Normal operation (writable folder)
   ✓ Read-only environment (Program Files simulation)
   ✓ Migration from primary to fallback
   ✓ Fresh install in read-only location
   ✓ Cross-platform paths (Windows/Linux/Mac)

6. User Experience:
   - Completely transparent to users
   - No error messages about permissions
   - Settings always work regardless of install location
   - Automatic migration preserves user preferences

VERIFICATION:
============
Run check_settings_location.py to see current settings location status.

NEXT STEPS:
==========
1. Test with actual Program Files installation
2. Build new executable with PyInstaller
3. Verify on clean Windows system
4. Update version number if needed
