# Quick Start: Building with Auto-Version Increment

## TL;DR
```batch
buildme.bat
```
That's it! Version auto-increments and builds.

---

## What Happens

### Before Build
```python
# In neight.py (line 19)
VERSION = "2025.003"
```

### Run Build
```batch
C:\DevTemp\neight> buildme.bat
```

### Output
```
========================================
Neight Enhanced Build Script
========================================

Incrementing version number...
File: C:\DevTemp\neight\neight.py

✓ Version updated: 2025.003 → 2025.004

Starting PyInstaller build...
[PyInstaller output...]

========================================
Build completed successfully!
========================================
```

### After Build
```python
# In neight.py (line 19) - AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED
VERSION = "2025.004"
```

### In the App
Open `dist\Neight.exe` → Help → About
```
Neight v2025.004 (Using PySide6)
A lightweight UTF-8 text editor with advanced features,
word count, line numbers and more.

## Build Script

**`buildme.bat`** - Always auto-increments version before building

> **Note:** Every build increments the version. If you want to keep the same version for testing, manually edit line 19 in `neight.py` after building to restore the previous version number.

---

## Version Format

```
2025.004
│    │
│    └─ Build number (001-999)
└────── Year
```

### Examples
- `2025.001` - First build of 2025
- `2025.042` - 42nd build of 2025
- `2026.001` - First build of 2026 (auto-resets)

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I run the build multiple times?**  
A: Yes! Each run increments the version.

**Q: What if I want to keep the same version?**  
A: After building, manually edit `neight.py` line 19 to restore the previous version.

**Q: How do I manually set a version?**  
A: Edit line 19 in `neight.py`: `VERSION = "2025.XXX"`

**Q: What if I mess up the version?**  
A: Just edit `neight.py` line 19 to the correct version.

**Q: Does this affect the exe file?**  
A: Yes! The About box in the exe will show the new version.

## Files Modified by Build

- ✏️ `neight.py` - VERSION updated (line 19)
- 📦 `dist\Neight.exe` - New executable created
- 📁 `build\` - Build artifacts

## Workflow Recommendation

1. **Code**: Make your changes to `neight.py`
2. **Build**: Run `buildme.bat`
3. **Test**: Run `dist\Neight.exe` and verify in About box
4. **Document**: Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version
5. **Commit**: Commit all changes including version bump

```batch
git add neight.py CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Release v2025.004: Feature description"
git tag v2025.004
git push origin main --tags
```
