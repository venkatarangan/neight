# Neight – Notepad Enhanced, AI-Built and Tamil-Friendly

**Current Version: 2025.005** | [See CHANGELOG.md](changes/CHANGELOG.md) for version history

**Neight** is a lightweight text editor for Windows inspired by Notepad but enhanced with a few thoughtful additions. It's designed mainly for my personal writing workflow in Tamil and English — and as an experiment in building a complete, usable Windows app entirely through Generative AI.

> **Note:** Version numbers are incremented with each new build/feature release. Check **Help → About** in the application to see your current version.

3. **Optional**: Pin `Neight.exe` to your **Start Menu** or **Taskbar** for quick access
4. Double-click to run!

**Note:** Since there's no Windows installer yet, Windows Defender SmartScreen might show a warning on first run. Click "More info" → "Run anyway" to proceed.

## Why I built Neight

Around **Early 2025**, I ran into a problem.
In **Windows 11**, with the new **Tamil (India) - Tamil Anjal keyboard layout**, the built-in Notepad.exe started showing rendering issues with Tamil Unicode text. Strangely, everywhere else — browsers, Word, system UI — worked fine. Only Notepad struggled.

The new Notepad (with Copilot integration) probably uses a different text control from the earlier version that had tab support, and something about that broke Tamil input.

I tried alternatives:

* **Sublime Text** works, but it’s paid and overkill for quick Tamil typing.
* **Notepad++** is powerful but too cluttered.
* **Visual Studio Code** is great but not for a few quick paragraphs in Tamil and English.

For my use case — daily Tamil social media posts and weekly magazine columns — I needed something simple, fast and predictable.

**iA Writer** came close, but even that failed with Tamil word selection shortcuts.

So I decided to scratch the itch myself. Using **GPT-5**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Preview)**, I generated a new notepad-like app from scratch — **Neight**.

The twist: I didn’t type code manually except for minor display texts. Everything was AI-generated, refined, and assembled through prompts inside VS Code. I continue to maintain it the same way, as an ongoing experiment in AI-assisted software creation.

## Clone the Repository

If you want the full source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/venkatarangan/neight.git
cd neight
```

Then grab `dist\Neight.exe` from the downloaded folder.

### Settings File Location

When you run Neight, it automatically creates a `settings.json` file:
- **If installed in a writable folder**: Settings are saved in the same folder as the executable
- **If installed in Program Files**: Settings are saved to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Neight\settings.json`

The app automatically detects write permissions and chooses the appropriate location.

---

## Building Neight from Source

**Requirements**

* **Python 3.10+**
* **PySide6** (Qt bindings)
* **markdown** (for PDF export of markdown files)

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install individually:
```bash
pip install PySide6
pip install markdown
```

**To build the executable:**

```
python -m pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile neight.py
```

After the build completes, your compiled file will be in the **dist** folder.

---

## Running Neight

* Tested on **Windows 11 (25H2)**
* Requires Tamil (India) – Tamil Anjal and English (India) keyboard layouts installed

Run the app once and it will create a **settings.json** file next to the executable.
It stores your preferences (font, window size, last opened file, autosave interval, etc.).

When launched through Windows "Open with…", the referenced file now opens with the correct window title and save path.

---

## How it works (briefly)

Neight uses **PySide6**, the official Qt6 Python binding, to handle:

* The text editor (`QPlainTextEdit`)
* Menus, dialogs, and status bar
* Persistent settings stored in JSON
* A small **ctypes** module for Windows API calls to switch keyboard layouts programmatically

All preferences are remembered automatically, including fonts, window size, and autosave intervals.

It’s a single Python file — self-contained and clean — yet offers everything you expect from a modern, minimal text editor.

## Configuration and File Structure

When you run Neight, it automatically creates:

```
settings.json
```

**Location:**
* **Development/Portable:** Same directory as the executable (if writable)
* **Program Files Install:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Neight\settings.json`
  - Typical path: `C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Neight\settings.json`

The app automatically detects write permissions and uses the appropriate location.
If you move the app from a writable location to Program Files, settings are automatically migrated to AppData.

This file remembers:

* Last opened file
* Font family and size
* Word wrap setting
* Window size
* Auto-save interval
* Last used directory

## The Name

The name **Neight** came from **NotepadEnhanced → NotepadE  → N8 → Neight**.
It’s short, memorable, and unique.

The icon was AI-generated from a Python script written by GPT-5.
The green tones were chosen to match the colour scheme from my blog [venkatarangan.com](https://venkatarangan.com).

---

## Future Ideas

* ~~Basic **Markdown** support~~ ✓ **Implemented in v2025.001!**
* ~~Export to **PDF**~~ ✓ **Implemented in v2025.001!**
* Markdown **live preview** pane
* Export to **DOCX**
* A proper **Windows Installer**
* Page numbers in PDF footer
* Print preview before PDF export
* Optional **AI features** for translation, rewriting, or lookup
* Integrate Tamil dictionary (like Tamil Nadu Government's Sorkuvai)

## Known issues

Tamil text navigation in Qt-based editors (used by Neight via PySide6) has a segmentation quirk: consonant + pulli (virama U+0BCD) + consonant sequences are treated as a single grapheme cluster. That means the caret and selection can jump over the whole unit when you press Left/Right or Backspace, instead of moving between the letters. Examples you might see: “ர்க”, “ண்டு”, “ல்லா”, “த்த”, “ங்கு”, “ப்பி”. Ideally, you should be able to move from “ர்” to “க” (and similar), but Qt currently only lets you land before or after the pair.

Expected behavior is to segment after the pulli for consonant+pulli+consonant (two logical letters), while still keeping consonant+pulli+vowel‑sign as one cluster. Until Qt adjusts Tamil-specific grapheme segmentation, Tamil users may notice unintuitive caret movement and selection in Neight and other Qt apps. If you encounter this, it would help the community to file or upvote a report on the Qt Forums (please search for an existing thread first). A detailed write‑up with code points and reproduction steps is available in [knownbugs/Bug in QT for Tamil text handling.md](knownbugs/Bug%20in%20QT%20for%20Tamil%20text%20handling.md).

## Acknowledgement of AI

This project was entirely built using **AI tools**:
**GPT-5 (ChatGPT)**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Preview)**, with **GPT-5 Codex (Preview)** for improvements.
I didn’t manually write the code, except for text and configuration tweaks.
It’s a working demonstration of what’s now possible with AI-driven coding.
