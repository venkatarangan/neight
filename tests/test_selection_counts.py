"""Status bar counts for a selection must agree with the document's.

Qt hands back two different spellings of the same text: `toPlainText()` uses
`\\n` between paragraphs, `selectedText()` uses U+2029.  Counting a selection
straight from `selectedText()` therefore drifts from the document counts on any
multi-paragraph text -- silently, and only for users who write in paragraphs.
Selecting everything is the case that pins it down: the two must agree exactly.

Also guards the delay asymmetry.  Selection counts appear on a 250 ms timer so
that transient selections never reach the status bar, but they must disappear
*immediately* when the selection is cleared -- a lingering "42 of 1240" that
describes a selection the user has already dismissed is worse than no feature.
The timer slot is invoked directly rather than waited on: these are plain
scripts with no event loop spinning.
